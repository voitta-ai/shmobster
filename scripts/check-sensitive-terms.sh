# check-sensitive-terms.sh - pre-publish gate for this public repo.
#
# Ported from voitta-ai/skillz (scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh); the checks
# are generic, only the wordlist path and the default scan targets differ.
#
# Greps the given files/dirs for content that must never be published: key and
# token shapes, cloud account ids, private IPs, internal-domain hostnames.
# shmobster ships example configs, a launchd plist sample and pasted terminal
# output, which is exactly the material a real value hides in. Exits non-zero
# on a match, so it can gate CI or a pre-push hook.
#
# The paradox the original design resolves: a denylist of *names* (clients,
# employers, hosts) is itself sensitive and cannot live in a public repo. So
# this script ships only STRUCTURAL patterns, and reads any name-based terms
# from a PRIVATE, out-of-repo wordlist (one term per line; blank lines and
# lines starting with # ignored), at $SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE, default
# ~/.config/shmobster/sensitive-terms.txt.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh <path> [<path> ...]
#   SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE=/other/list.txt \
#     scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh shmobster/ examples/
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = matches found, 2 = usage error or a
# SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE that was set but does not exist.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default); no bashisms beyond 3.2.
