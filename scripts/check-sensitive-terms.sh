# check-sensitive-terms.sh - pre-publish gate for this public repo.
#
# Ported from voitta-ai/skillz (scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh); the checks
# are generic, only the wordlist path and the default scan targets differ.
#
# Greps the given files/dirs for content that must never be published: key and
# token shapes, cloud account ids, private IPs, internal-domain hostnames.
# shmobster ships example configs, a launchd plist sample and pasted terminal
# output, which is exactly the material a real value hides in. Exits non-zero
# on a match, so it can gate CI or a pre-push hook.
#
# The paradox the original design resolves: a denylist of *names* (clients,
# employers, hosts) is itself sensitive and cannot live in a public repo. So
# this script ships only STRUCTURAL patterns, and reads any name-based terms
# from a PRIVATE, out-of-repo wordlist (one term per line; blank lines and
# lines starting with # ignored), at $SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE, default
# ~/.config/shmobster/sensitive-terms.txt and then ~/.config/skillz/.
#
# The shared fallback is not tidiness. A wordlist is per MACHINE, not per repo:
# the names that must not be published are the same whichever checkout you are
# standing in. Measured 2026-09-16 -- the shmobster path was empty while the
# skillz one held 34 terms, so every run here passed with the name half off
# while the list that would have caught something sat one directory away.
#
# And a run WITHOUT a wordlist no longer reports a bare "clean". It did, on
# stdout, with the explanation on stderr where a caller reading the result does
# not look -- a gate that cannot do its job saying the same word as one that
# did. Set SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_REQUIRED=1 to make the absence fatal;
# CI leaves it unset on purpose, because a private wordlist cannot live on a
# public runner and structural-only is the honest best it can do there.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh <path> [<path> ...]
#   SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE=/other/list.txt \
#     scripts/check-sensitive-terms.sh shmobster/ examples/
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = matches found, 2 = usage error, a
# SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_FILE that was set but does not exist, or no
# wordlist found at all while SHMOBSTER_SENSITIVE_TERMS_REQUIRED=1.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default); no bashisms beyond 3.2.
